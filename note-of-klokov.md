by introduction some auxiliary exercise to build balance muscle

knees more out and your feet never move when doing dead lift.

- SNATCH: why `SHOULDER` should more forward to the level beyond the barbell, and CLEAN DONT DO THAT

the back would have longer movement, more power

- when the dead lift training should be slower

you can feel whether your position and leg muscle feels right, you're not losing your center

- why do not shrug during the `HIGH PULL`

'cause it would move the barbell forward, and beside the shrug will stop the barbell, millsecond.
